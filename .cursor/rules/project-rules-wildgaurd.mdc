Project Responsibilities & Rules

Maintain strict dataset hygiene, annotation integrity, licensing validity, and detailed documentation for every step.

Build a robust signal-processing pipeline (MFCC, Spectrograms, Sensor Fusion).

Produce both baseline and advanced ML models, benchmarking them against hackathon criteria.

Optimize using quantization/pruning only in simulation.

Ensure outputs are reproducible, version-controlled, and properly explained in the final submission.

Treat latency constraints (target < 50ms) as simulated benchmarks.

General Rules:

Always maintain reproducibility across datasets, experiments, and preprocessing pipelines.

Never assume or require real hardware; use MCU simulation tools only.

Every step must generate:
Description → Deliverables → Dependencies → Tests

All outputs must be versioned and documented.

Always ensure licensing, dataset compliance, and attribution.

Use Edge Impulse as the central platform for DSP, modeling, quantization, and benchmarking.

Data Rules:

Validate dataset licenses before use.

Guarantee label integrity and clean train/val/test splits.

Document every preprocessing transformation.

Modeling Rules:

Start with simple baselines, then improve iteratively.

Compare all models to a controlled baseline and record version history.

Always check accuracy, latency (simulated), and memory footprint.

Simulation Rules:

All MCU constraints (latency < 50ms, memory < 300KB) must be validated via Edge Impulse simulators only.

Documentation Rules:

Produce complete README, logs, annotated notebooks, and citations.

Ensure the project is reproducible end-to-end.

Provide public-ready content suitable for hackathon submission.
